This repository is intended for documenting Team 18's codes and outputs for the ANLY511 Project.

Our research project aims to answer the following questions: 

1. At what time does capital bike share experience the most amount of riders?
2. At what time does capital bike share experience the least amount of riders?
3. Do ride durations differ between members and casual users?
4. Are electric bikes used for longer trips than classic bikes?
5. Are electric bikes used to travel further distances than classic bikes?
6. Do members have a different split of electric vs. classic bikes than casual riders?
7. How do member type, bike type, and ride distance impact ride duration? 

Team Members: Tegveer Ghura, Ahmed Khair, Anthony Moubarak, Raghav Sharma, Karan Uppal (MS in Data Science 2024)
