				<h2>Topic Introduction</h2>
				<p>“The only constant in life is change” ~ Heraclitus
                    Heraclitus’s so simple yet so clear message is applicable to everything in life, nothing remains the way it is, and nothing stays in its current state, for those who do are deemed to fail the test of time and evolution.
                    The entertainment industry is no exception to the above rules, with film and music having almost unrecognizably changed ever since their inception. Many historians consider music to have been part of the world as early as 35000 years ago, and the number of times this medium of art has changed and been adopted differently ever since is almost infinite. However, even within the last century, music (and the music industry) has changed so many times and taken so many forms. Below is a look at the most popular music from their respective times:
                    V1, V2, V3
                    The instruments, the lyrics, the feel, and many more are so distinctive from each other. A couple of common ways people from older generations describe new music are: Simple, stupid, empty, illiterate, etc.
                    Whether they are right or wrong is up for debate as the beauty of art and music lies in their subjectivity. However, what is undeniable is how much disarray there is when it comes to comparing older music to newer music, both from a musical perspective and from a cultural perception perspective. This project focuses on examining this disarray from a data science angle to further our understanding of the phenomenon and enigma that is “Music popularity”
