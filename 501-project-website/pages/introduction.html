				<h2>Topic Introduction</h2>
				<br>
				<p> 'The only constant in life is change' ~ Heraclitus
					<br><br>
                    Heraclitus’s so simple yet so clear message is applicable to everything in life, nothing remains the way it is, and nothing stays in its current state, for those who do are deemed to fail the test of time and evolution.
					<br><br>
                    The entertainment industry is no exception to the above rules, with film and music having almost unrecognizably changed ever since their inception. Many historians consider music to have been part of the world as early as 35000 years ago, and the number of times this medium of art has changed and been adopted differently ever since is almost infinite. 
					<br><br>
					However, even within the last century, music (and the music industry) has changed so many times and taken so many forms. Below is a look at the most popular music from their respective times:
					<br><br>
                    V1 (will upload at later stages)
					<br><br>
					V2 (will upload at later stages)
					<br><br>
					V3 (will upload at later stages)
					<br><br>
					
                    The instruments, the lyrics, the feel, and many more features are so different from each other despite the time difference being so relatively minimal (less than 100 years).
					
					<br><br>
					A couple of common ways people from older generations describe new music are: Simple, stupid, empty, illiterate, etc. <br><br>
                    Whether they are right or wrong is up for debate as the beauty of art and music lies in their subjectivity. However, what is undeniable is how much disarray there is when it comes to comparing older music to newer music, both from a musical perspective and from a cultural perception perspective. 
					
					<br><br>

					My personal motivation to do this project is the fact that over the pasy year, the younger generations (so called Gen Z) were exposed to several 
					high profile classic songs that are far from today's style of popular music and the response was very interesting. The three major exmaples of that are:
					<br><br>			
					>"Something in the way" by Nirvana was played during the opening and closing scenes of "The Batman" <br><br>
					> "Running up that hill" by Kate Bush was played during episode 4 of Stranger Things Season 4. <br><br>
					> "Master of the puppets" by Metallica was played during episode 9 of Stranger Things Season 4. <br><br>

					Despite being as far to modern day music as could be, all three tracks blew up (more details on that in the EDA section). This made me instantly 
					question how does music get popular and what are the factors that make people like ceirtan songs as compared to others.

					<br><br>


					This project focuses on examining this disarray from a data science angle to further our understanding of the phenomenon and enigma that is “Music popularity”.
