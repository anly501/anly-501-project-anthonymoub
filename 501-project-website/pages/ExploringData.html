        <p>    Exploring data is a huge process and takes a lot of time and digging into all the variables in the datasets gathered. In the 
          case of this project, around 30 music related variables were gathered for analysis, which made the data exploring process chaotic. For this
          reason, i decided to split the exploration into three seperate parts: <br><br>

          > Analyzing how the music itself (music related features) <br>
          > Analyzing the lyrics <br>
          > Analyzing the change in the industry as a whole (band types, etc.) <br><br>



        </p>
				<h1>Part One: Understanding how music has changed over the years.</h1>
        <br>
				<p> As mentioned in the data gathering section, the Spotify API provided with a lot of music related features. As an inintial 
          analysis, the four features picked for analysis (with how Spotify defines them): <br><br>

          >Speechiness: Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like 
          the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value."Rap God" by Eminem
          is an example of a song with high speechiness.<br><br>

          >Instrumentalness: Predicts whether a track contains no vocals, the closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater 
          likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Hans zimmer, bach, or any other composer's tracks are very high in instrumentalness. <br><br>

          >Duration: The duration of the track in milliseconds.  <br><br>

          >Danceability: Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity.
          A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable. "Billie Jean" is a song with high danceability. <br><br>

          <br><br>

          Below are four line plots that summarize how these features have changed in Billboardâ€™s top 100 yealry songs ever since the 
          1950s. <br><br>
