				<h2>Topic Introduction</h2>
				<br>
				<p> 
					Deep learning is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that has emerged in recent years as a result of advancements in computing power, the availability of large amounts of data, and the development of more sophisticated algorithms. It builds upon earlier AI techniques, such as machine learning and neural networks, but uses much larger and more complex neural network architectures. This has enabled deep learning to tackle problems that were previously thought to be beyond the reach of AI, such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous decision making. The success of deep learning has led to its widespread adoption across a range of industries, from healthcare and finance to self-driving cars and robotics. As a result, it is now one of the fastest-growing areas of AI research and development, with exciting new breakthroughs being made all the time.
					<br><br>
					Just like any concept in Data Science, deep learning’s applications can run from very simple problems that can be worked on individually to complex problems that require several teams, a lot of computational power, and experts in the field to properly tackle. Being an aspiring data scientist, I decided to explore the field of Deep Learning with a very simplistic project I found on YouTube.(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy-R4oUZaC8&t=769s" style="color: rgb(39, 160, 204)">Video</a>)
					<br><br>
					This project focuses on using Deep Learning to build a classification model that detects a sport based on an inputted image of a ball. For example, if a user inputs the image of a golf ball, the classification algorithm returns “Golf”. The simplicity and intuition of this project made it a perfect introduction to the world of deep learning and how it could be used in computer vision and image classification, which are fields that fascinate me.
